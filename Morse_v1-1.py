 Description  : Blinks a led in fonction of a word done by the user in Morse style                         
                Using the GPIO with a led pinned on the pin 11 (GPIO17)                                    
 auther       : AlcaÃ¯no Jean-Marc                                                                          
 modification : 2023/11/16                                                                                 
 version      : V 1.1
 
############################################################################################################

 Version note :
 
 - Comments and program structure's update
 - Uses True and False arguments instead of GPIO.HIGH and GPIO.LOW
 - Test of ON and OFF led blink to study the effect of time.sleep() method on durations vs Morse code and their display for testing
    -> '.'  = 0.25"
    
    -> '-'  = 0.75" (same as three '.')
    
    -> ' '  = 0.25" (gap between two impulsions for a letter -> same as one '.')
    
    -> '_'  = 0.75" (gap between two letters of the same word -> same as one '-')
    
    -> '/'  = 1.75" (space between two words -> same as seven '.')
- Code table for each character defined by a list.
- Definition of new functions for decoding Morse code table, user menu, exceptions for bad entries...

Future ehancements :

 - Morse code learning mode.
 - Impulsions decoding.
 - Add a button on the board to impulse a code.
 - Add a speaker to play the impulsion.
 - Code and decode mode.
 - Decode a real radio reception by SDR
